Fourier Transform is used to analyze the frequency characteristics of various filters. For images, 2D Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is used to find the frequency domain. A fast algorithm called Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is used for calculation of DFT. Details about these can be found in any image processing or signal processing textbooks.
